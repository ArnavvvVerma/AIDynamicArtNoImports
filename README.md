# ðŸ§  AI Dynamic Art NFT (On-Chain, No Imports / No Constructor)

This project contains a **fully on-chain NFT smart contract** written in **pure Solidity**, designed for **AI-generated art with dynamic metadata**.

The NFTs are created and rendered directly from the blockchain â€” no off-chain storage or dependencies.  
Every token produces its own evolving SVG artwork, which changes subtly based on block data such as timestamps and hashes.

## ðŸŽ¨ Features

âœ… **Pure On-Chain Metadata**  
Each tokenâ€™s metadata and image are generated entirely within the smart contract â€” stored as Base64 JSON + SVG.

âœ… **Dynamic Artwork**  
Art dynamically evolves using blockchain data:
- `block.timestamp`
- `blockhash`
- `block.coinbase`

âœ… **No External Calls / No Storage Reads for Metadata**  
All art data is computed in real-time, ensuring maximum transparency and verifiability.

âœ… **Simple Minting**  
Anyone can mint by calling:
```solidity
mint()
